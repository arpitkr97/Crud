# Crud

CRUD, short for Create, Read, Update, Delete, is a fundamental concept in web development that involves performing basic operations on data stored in databases. CRUD represents the four main operations that can be performed on data: creating new records, reading existing records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

CRUD is a critical aspect of many web applications and is used to manage and manipulate data in various forms, such as user profiles, articles, products, and more. It serves as the backbone of many web-based systems, from simple websites to complex applications, and is widely used across different programming languages, frameworks, and databases.
